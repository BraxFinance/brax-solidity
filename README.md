## What is Brax?

BRAX (Bitcoin FRAX) takes inspiration from FRAX in creating a fractional-algorithmic wrapped Bitcoin alternative. In order to utilize Bitcoin on EVM and smart contract chains, there needs to be an EVM compatible version of it on-chain that can be redeemed for an equivalent amount of Bitcoin. This can be done in a number of ways:

-   **Centralized Custodian** - A centralized, trusted entity holds Bitcoin in a secure vault and mints a wrapped Bitcoin equivalent on chain. An example of this is the most popular wrapped Bitcoin, wBTC.
-   **Decentralized Custodian** - A protocol governed by some consensus mechanism holds Bitcoin in a wallet and mints a wrapped Bitcoin token. An example of this is renBTC.
-   **Overcollateralized** - Overcollateralize a loan to borrow a synthetic version of Bitcoin, sBTC.
-   **Algorithmic** - Unbacked bitcoin uses supply expansion and contraction to try to keep a 1:1 peg Bitcoin.

FRAX has shown that there is another alternative to this, being Fractional-Algorithmic. This means that the backing of the token is partially collateralized and partially algorithmic. The ratio of this is based on the pricing of the FRAX token, if FRAX is above $1 then the protocol allows for decrease of the Collateralization Ratio, if itâ€™s trading below then it will allow for increase of it.

BRAX will take inspiration from this to make a Bitcoin equivalent that can match the scalability, stability and trustlessness of FRAX that it has proven over the past year. BRAX will launch with the same ideals as FRAX, utilizing a stepped collateralization ratio controlled by the collateral refresh function. This can be called once per hour and will change the collateral ratio in steps of .25% depending if 1 BRAX is above or below 1 Bitcoin in value.

Frax is the first fractional-algorithmic stablecoin protocol. Frax is open-source, permissionless, and entirely on-chain â€“ currently implemented on Ethereum (with possible cross chain implementations in the future). The end goal of the Frax protocol is to provide a highly scalable, decentralized, algorithmic money in place of fixed-supply digital assets like BTC.

## Running tests

Testing requires two terminals, one to run a localhost hardhat node and one to connect and run the tests

Console 1: Node

```
cd ./src/hardhat
npx hardhat node
```

Console 2: Client

```
cd ./src/hardhat
yarn test [optional: test/filename.ts]
```
